1.Upload & Auto-Clean Data
Upload a CSV containing revenue, expenses, profit, or other financial metrics. The built-in cleaning tool standardizes numbers, fills missing values, and checks for outliers.

2.Monte Carlo Simulation
The app runs 1,000 simulations to model possible future outcomes, including ROI, profit probabilities, and risk levels.

3.Financial Storytelling
Converts simulation results into plain-language stories and scenario “chapters” (excellent, good, neutral, poor, crisis) for decision-makers.

4.Interactive Dashboard
View expected net income, ROI, risk levels, and scenario distributions in a clean Streamlit interface.

5.Chat-Style Agent
Ask questions about your uploaded data or tell the agent to “run simulation” or “tell me a financial story.”


Note:-
This runs on local LLM (Deepseek:R1 Latest). use ollama to pull the llm. and to run download all the files to Vsvode or Pycharm and in terminal run command streamlit run stremlit_ui.py
